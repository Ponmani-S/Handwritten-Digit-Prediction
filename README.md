# Handwritten Digit Prediction Using Classification Analysis

## Objectives
- Develop a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits.
- Evaluate and compare the performance of different classification algorithms.
- Achieve high accuracy in predicting the correct digit from a handwritten image.

## Data Source
- The MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits.

## Methodology
- Data loading and preprocessing.
- Visualization of the data.
- Training various classification models.
- Evaluating the performance of each model.
- Making predictions using the best-performing model.

## Results
- The models were evaluated based on classification reports and confusion matrices.
- Random Forest Classifier achieved high accuracy and was used for final predictions.
